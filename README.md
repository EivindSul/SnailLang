# Snail
Lua-like language designed to be embedded.
Uses tables and lists rather than objects to create any structure you want,
while still retaining relative simplicity for simple tasks.

The main selling point from lua is the addition of functional elements,
namely pattern matching.
(The first iteration is just switch/case with non-verbose syntax)
